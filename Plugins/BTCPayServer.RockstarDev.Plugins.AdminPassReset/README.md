# Admin Pass Reset, Plugin for BTCPay Server

This plugin is designed to address the issue of forgotten passwords on older BTCPay Server instances. If you follow
the [FAQ documentation on resetting a forgotten server admin password](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/FAQ/ServerSettings/#forgot-btcpay-admin-password), you’ll
end up with a new server admin account but without access to old stores.

For those who don’t have SMTP server credentials handy, I created this plugin as a solution. Additionally, this plugin serves as a quick demo and a showcase of
the plugin system - illustrating how the BTCPay team can't stop users from making risky decisions with their server. Now that this plugin exists, anyone added
as a server admin to your BTCPay instance can easily reset your password.

**With great power comes great responsibility.**

2. Once installed, you'll see the Admin Pass Reset plugin listed in the left sidebar of BTCPay Server.
3. Click the link, and you'll be presented with a form where you can reset the password of any user by entering their email address and clicking the "Reset
   Password" button.
4. A link will be displayed, which you can click to reset the user's password.

## Contributing to plugin development

You shouldn't. Like, seriously. The BTCPay team has improved the onboarding process in version 2.0, and you can already do this without the plugin. This is just
a temporary solution for those who haven’t upgraded to 2.0 yet.
